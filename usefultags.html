		<p> These are some sort of unorganized practicing work as outcome of what I have been learning about html and css.
		On this page I am going to write three of my fevourite word definitions, these are: </p>
		<section>
		<ul>
			<li>Indie</li>
			<li>Hope</li>
			<li>Compassion</li>
		</ul>
		</section>

		<h2>Indie</h2>
		<p>"Being indie" is about a self-representation that highlights your uniqueness. It means independent thinking, making decisions based on your own internal compass instead of going with outside voices. It's more than what you wear and what bands you listen to; indie is a culture and a way of thinking.</p> 

		<h2> Hope</h2>
		<p> A confident feeling about what will happen in the future.</p>

		<h2> Compassion</h2>
		<p> A strong feeling of sympathy or sadness for the pain or bad luck of others and a wish to help them.<p/>
